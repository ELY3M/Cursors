Nordiska bondkvinnor på 1800-talet
Nordic farmwifes in 19th century

When I was 10 or so years old I first got my hands on the romanitc novel “Prostmamseln” (the priest daughter) by Margit Söderholm. After reading it non-stop I was hooked forever and started to look for more books by the same author. I knew she had written a book that was filmed in the early 50s too, and that particular book (Driver dagg, faller regn) turned out to be the first of 4 about the everyday farm life in the Swedish province Hälsingland during mid-19th-century. Of course the books contains tear dripping love stories that makes your heart beat extra, but they also contain interesting descriptions of the every day life at this time and weddings and holidays are described in detail!

A few years back I also started to do some genealogy studies, which is rather “easy” during the first 200 years or so, cause the old church archive books are in order and written with readable handwriting. Following my old (and poor) anscestors through the church archives makes you curious about their lives, and even if the ones I’m researching now are from southern Sweden, the farm lives did not differ that much between the life described in Margit’s novels. So reading them again for the 25th or so time =o) brings me closer to my old anscestors too!

So for the love of Margit Söderholm’s novels, and to honour my anscestors I have decided to make this set of icons. The picture above is from another great novel’s backcover, and the author is called Anne Karin Elstad. She’s Norwegian, but since Norway has been Swedish not too long ago, the lives in this time in the country side does not differ much, why the Innhaug books by her should be mentioned in this honour too!

Ablout the icons:
Fäbod - “Cattle cottage”
In the summer the farmers took the animals up to a “fäbod” - a smaller version of the farm - several miles from home (it could take a day to walk there) to graze in the forrest lands and get strong for the long and cold winter. The rich farmers even had a “bolandsgård” half way up to the “fäbod” where they brought down the animals for a period in the middle of the summer (i.e July some time) while the grass up around the fäbod recovered. At the fäbod there were usually just one or two of the “pigor” (working girls/women at the farm, not part of the family, usually from poor families) depending on how rich the farm was and how many animals they had, and maybe some children (prospecting “pigor” and “drängar”) to help as shepherds.
At the fäbod the work consisted of taking care of all the milk the cows and goats milked during the summer. Butter, cheese and sour milk was produced to be sold in the markets and some to be eaten too. In the “spare time” there’s always wool too take care of. More on this later.

Psalmbok (m. näsduk) - Hymn book with handkerchief
In “Prostmamseln” there’s a description of this book of hymns that should be red with a golden heart on and the man gives his future wife as a “fästmansgåva” when they get engaged. The church was a very important part of the lives then, and a law also said that they should go to church every Sunday, so they didn’t have much choice... The hymn book was almost as common to own as the Bible, but I don’t know how spread this particular version of it is, or even if it’s just made up by Margit to create a cute atmosphere!

Brudkrona - Brides Crown
I know about this however! This particular crown is my replica of the one showing up on Marit's head in the film I told you about above! Since the film is black and white I'm not sure about what metal it is in it, but I'm guessing it's a mixture of brass and silver in it. This is anyway an important part of a woman’s life at this time. You could borrow the crown from the church when you got married, but only if you were a virgin at the wedding. Then you could be a “kronbrud”. The wedding dress was the black church dress, but they decorated it with a silver belt with silk napkins (if they were rich enough to have any) hanging from it, chains and cloth flowers and necklesses etc. I've even read somewhere that the crown should be completely covered with flowers etc, so none of the metal showed. And if it turned out later that the bride was not a virgin during the wedding the crown would turn black and would be very hard to polish! The vail didn’t appear in the wedding dress until late 19th century among the farmers, and the white dress were not wide spread until this century, when they didn’t have the black church dress anymore.

Vagga - Cradle
Babies of course was another important part of a woman’s life. The cradle for the baby were often inheritated through the generations, and could be up to 300 years old! Each family had their own special patterns and decorations and many of the furniture in the house were painted with the same kind of decorations.

Nycklar - Keys 
The “bondmora” (the farmer’s wife) were in charge of the household with all the food and stuff. The keys to the “härbärge” (meat storage) and “visthusbod” (seed and bread and stuff) was her responsablility, and if they were not too large she had them tied to her belt. However these keys were often made by some smith in the family years ago, and the size of them could be quite impressive. So sometimes they had a hook on the kitchen wall were they hung instead.

Brödspade - bread spade
The old farm life were rather ”simple” when it came to things to do. Taking care of the cows and other animals, and the products from them, taking care of the harvest and bake bread etc from it and third make clothes! Brödspaden therefore represents the breadbaking.

Räfsa - rake
During the harvest all the people in the farm were out in the fields to help with the harvest. The women’s work was to use the rake and to make cheafs of the harvest. Some women helped cutting too, but that was not very common in larger farms were many helped.

Lin - flax
A harvest that you didn’t eat but was very important anyway was the flax that you made linen clothes of. The flax fields are beautifully blue when they bloom! But the work to make the linen thread from the plant is very hard! First it has to be “rötat” i.e put in sacks in water (river or pond) so the hard stems are softened. Then there are several processes before you get the fibres out that you make the thread from.

Fårsax - shearing scissors
This old style of scissors to shear the sheep with worked more like a knife than a scissors. It was women’s work to shear the sheep in some of the farms.

Kardor - carding brushes
The evening work for the women in many farms. Except in Sundays the people always worked with something! In the evenings in front of the fire place before they went to bed, the women carded or spun and the men were doing some handy work with wood or fixing some leather peices for the horses or something. Carding the wool is necessary to be able to spin it later. Pigor and the poor people who went from farm to farm in  those days helped with this kind of work too, cause there were always enough to do!

Spinnrock - spinning wheel
The other perpetum mobilum in the farm wifes lives. To cheer this boring hard work up a bit they used to gather all females in the village in so called “rock stugor” were they sat for a whole day spinning and listening to gossip. These took place during the winter when there were not much else work waiting for the spring again.

Vävskyttel - loom shuttle
This is where the thread for the weaving is rolled. I had to symbolize the last major step of the textuile making too...

Trefotkittel - threefeet pot
A big iron pot where water and soup and other food were boiled. This was the oldest version. Then they had separate threefeets where they put pots on in the open fires, and after that the iron stoves came.

Smörkärna - butter churn
The feeding was the last major part of the household, and with this item you make butter from the milk. Most of the butter were sold to the markets, and instead they used fat as we use margerine and butter today. Butter was just for rich people and holidays.

Tomte - goblin
This tiny character has nothing to do with today’s xmas tomte in Sweden. Superstition was a very important part of the lives back in these days. The tomte helped in the stable and barn and if you were nice to him you got a lot of help. If you were less nice the tomte left the farm and all sorts of bad things could start to happen, like cows breaking their legs, the seeds decreased in storage and things like that. So this little guy you had to be nice to.
