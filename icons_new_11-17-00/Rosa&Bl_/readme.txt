Annika's	"Rosa" and "Blå" Icons

1999 by Annika Messing <annikamessing@hotmail.com>

"Rosa" in Swedish means "pink" and it also is a girl's name.
First I made the "Blå" (means "blue") icons and then I wanted
to make them a little more "girlie", so…

The icons are created with ResEdit 2.1.3

If you distribute the icons, please don't change them.
Always send this ReadMe together with the icons.

Feel free to send me an e-mail!
