Hello there!  Well, this is the first diddy I've ever uploaded anywhere...
well, here's the story behind these silly icons... and don't worry, it's
short.  I downloaded icons off AOL and E-world.  I decided to make some of
my own and share them with equally silly, time-wasting people such as
myself.  The end.

There is no shareware fee or anything silly like that... but I would
appreciate an E-letter... you can write me at Kitten344@aol.com.  Please
write me!

Love and icons,
Kitty

A sorta sequel type thing... these are much much much MUCH better than the
first version- for those of you who haven't uploaded my first "dudes,"
folder dudes are new icons for folders-- little people with folders for
heads.  CUTE!!!  Well, I think my favorites here are Skeleton dude,
Frankendude (Halloween), Married dudes (valentines Day), and Statue of
Liberty Dude.  This collection has icons for:  Halloween, Fourth of July,
Easter, Valentines Day, and more!

No shareware fee- those are really silly.
Please e-mail me at Kitten344 to tell me what you think!
