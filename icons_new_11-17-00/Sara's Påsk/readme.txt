This set is my tribute to Easter! It's been sitting at my harddrive 
for more than a year, since I didn't get it out last easter, and now 
I have completed it with some more icons. 
Since I'm not the perfect artist I needed to borrow some of the icons 
as stationary from my collection, or thay wouldn't look like they do. 
Almost completely stolen is the cat - and I don't remember who did 
the original cat, but thanks for helping me complete my set! A påskkärring 
is not a påskkärring without her broom, cat and kettle... =o).

So what are they??
OK, I have to explain my easter things to you - and even if you're 
Swedish you don't necessarily recognize the stuff, we have some weird 
family traditions.... =o)

Påskkärring: 
In Sweden our witches are out for eastern instead of Halloween. 
They ride to Blåkulla (noone really knows where that is - but some people 
say it's situated on the island Blå Jungfrun outside Öland) the night 
between Skärtorsdag ("pink Thursday") and Långfredag ("long Friday") to 
party with "Hin Håle" - the devil him self. So on Thursday they will walk 
around in the cities to wish everybody a happy eastern and get some candy, 
maybe sing a little. A nice sort of trick or treat. Nowadays I have noticed 
that they sometimes bring handdrawn easter postcards too and give us. We 
didn't do that when I was a kid, but it's a very constructive way to 
develop the tradition!

When I was a kid I wouldn't miss this for the world, cause it meant: 
Mom's MakeUp kit!!! You're supposed to have big red roses on your cheeks, 
and they are not made with rouge, but with a screamy red/pink lipstick! 
Also the mouth should be red. And then eye shadow and mascara and the 
eyeliner was used to make large brown or black frickles on your cheeks! 
Then a cloth around your head, the right clothes (long skirt, an apron 
and a schal) a broom (kvast) in your hand, and you were off. With this 
costume you realize it's just as easy for boys to dress up as 
påskkärringar, and get away with it! She should have the coffee kettle 
(kittel) and the cat (svart katt) with her too, but it's a bit of a problem 
carrying all that around...

Oh, btw, påskkärring means "easter little lady". The kärring word is a bit 
of a mixture between an insult and a cute nickname nowadays, but it used 
to be all good. Kär means "in love" so I think you get the picture... 
It's sort of an old "darling"...

Textiltavletuppen:
This always comes out for easter. It's a wallhanging decoration with a 
rooster I made when I was very young. It's made from a kit you bought, 
and I was very proud of it, and still am. You had to cut cloth pieces 
out and paste them onto a rough weave piece, and for a 4-5 year old it's 
very difficult to cut nice things... =o) Nevertheless it should hang on 
the kitchen wall every eastern.

Strumpa vid spisen:
OK, here's a goofy family tradition. I don't know any of my friends 
who's had this when they were kids. It originates from my mom and she 
thinks it comes from her mother's home, and her granddad was Danish, 
so it _might_ be an old Danish, maybe now dead (?) tradition.
Anyway, just like all Anglo-ish people put a stocking by the fireplace 
for xmas, I do that the night when the påskkärringar goes to Blåkulla, 
and they come down the chimney and put candy for the easter eggs, and 
maybe a small gift in the stocking. Once I got a stampalbum in it, so 
it was good it was a large stocking that year! =o) And since we don't 
have many fireplaces in the houses here in Sweden (it's more a luxury 
detail than rule, at least here in the "warm" southern Sweden and in 
new houses) you have to hang it by the usual stove, so this is a 
modern version! =o)

Påskris:
You take a bunch of branches and put in a vase, then you decorate it 
with feathers and easter things, like tiny eggs, maybe tiny påskkärringar 
and bunnies. This tradition with branches in a vase we have two times 
actually. First around the old Fast in February (starting with Semlan 
or the Fastlagsbulle eating to live through it, though we don't really 
fast anymore...) to get a reminder of spring coming, and then for easter 
once again when it's really spring. The Fastlagsris might be decorated 
with colourful feathers too, or bare as it is. I think this tradition 
started when it was time to cut the trees in the garden to get better 
fruit trees etc. Then someone took the cut off branches in and put in 
water so they could still enjoy the bursting buds.

Chokladkanin:
In Sweden we don't really have an easter bunny, but like so many other 
holidays we get some other countries and cultures traditions intermingeled 
with our own, so when it's time to fill the stores with easter candy, the 
chocolate bunny is sure to be found. Also the bunny occures in easter "art", 
since a long time, for the same reason. But he doesn't have any purpose, 
like bringing eggs or whatever it is he's doing where he exsists as an 
active part of the easter tradition. In Sweden easter is eggs, hens and 
roosters, and the påskkärringar. Unless someone else has goofy family 
traditions... =o)

Godis Pappersägg:
A must have for easter! A paper egg, with the boring blue printed 
linepattern inside, the paperlacy edge and the colourful outside! 
Probably something German from start I'd think, but again I'm not 
sure. Fill it up with candy anyway and eat as many candy eggs you can! 
=o) Easy to fit in the stocking!

Min anka (=My duck):
However when I was a kid I got this beautiful plastic egg duck dressed 
with a clothy yellow layer. Or maybe it's supposed to be a chicken, 
but it sure looks like a duck =o). So even if there are those colourful 
paper eggs laying around everywhere, my duck should be filled with candy 
too! He's a bit worn now after 25+ years, but he's still a joyfull part 
of my easter tradition!

Ägg:
Naturellt - as you take it from the pack and boil it.
Dekorerat ägg - a typical simple "all Sara can do" pattern, with the 
ball-chicken, some easy geometrical patterns and that's it. We usually 
don't decorate the eggs that much nowadays, but it was fun when I was a 
kid to take the aquarells out and paint! Oh, my mom has found these 
stencil patterns you put the egg in and paint in the holes lately, 
so there might be one or two decorated eggs if she has felt up to it 
still...
Lökkokt ägg - I was taught this trick when I was about 10 or so. 
Just put the dry peals from an onion in the same water as the eggs 
when you boil them, and they will get this natural wonderful warm 
yellow colour. It does work with the red onions too, but it's not 
as nice red colour coming out as you might think. More of a redish 
orange thing. But still... Cheap and nice! And natural!

Fönsterkyckling (=window chicken):
Another can't live without! The only year we haven't had the chickens 
hanging from the kitchen curtain was when we went to visit dad's mom 
one easter 15 years or so ago. Then my aunt borrowed them, so they would 
still get the easter air filling their lungs!
My mom knitted (oh, it's called crochet when it's made with that hook 
needle thing...) these many many years ago, and I think they have been 
there for my whole life at least. They have been renovated many times 
since. The eyes are pepper and the beak is red yarn. The tail is a feather. 
They are adorable. We've experienced problems with them lately since Oscar 
(my parent's cat) can't keep his paws off them, so he usually "kills" 
2 or 3 of them the first day they are up in the curtain, and then 1-2 
per day the rest of the time they're up, so we've been forced to hang 
them higher (as if it would help!!), with not so long strings... 
Fortunately he's satisfied when he's got them down and kicked them 
around for a while, so you can just mend the string and hang them 
back up again... =o) There are 15 or so hanging all the way along 
the kitchen windows.

Skumägg:
My easter candy! They are not really egg shaped, but it still called 
"eggs", and it wouldn't be easter without the duck filled with them. 
Here are the three colour versions, and then there is a chocolate version 
too, that is just as jummy.

Marsipanägg:
Anthon Berg has an egg with a hard shell, chocolate inside and a pip 
of marzipan. A very late part of my traditions since I wasn't too fond 
of marzipan as a kid. Now I can eat one or two of these eggs and find 
them delicious.

Smörgåstårta:
Easter is somehow not a season for hot food dinners. 
(Sidetrack: Well, one time mom did this lamb steak with garlic that was 
absolutely jummy...) Oh well, we usually just take out the secret family 
recepy of smörgåstårta ("sandwish cake") one of the days, and it's never 
wrong. Forgive me, mom, for decorating this version with boiled eggs, 
but after all it is easter! The pink cover is prawns (Greenland version), 
the redish is smoked salmon, or if you prefer kaviar from 
Stenbit/Sjurygg/Kvabbso (the first name is really the name for the male 
fish but the kaviar is for some strange reason called Stenbitsrom 
anyway..., the middle name is the species name, and the last is the not 
very known name for the female fish, who gives the kaviar!! =o) 
Cyclopterus lumpus is the scientific name for it. ) marinated in cognac 
and spiced with a little chopped onions... Then we decorate with 
cucumber and kiwi for the colours, and lemon slices and dill. 
There's only so much you could fit in this tiny icon, but the decoration 
is usually very rich, so noone is disappointed. This is the iconic light 
version =o). The green around the edge of it is miniature chopped lettuce. 
But the internals I won't tell, cause that's the secret! =o)

Enjoy!

Legal mumbo:
You may not include the icons in any public clipart collection, 
you may not charge money for it, and if you wish to include it
